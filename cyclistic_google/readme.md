# Cyclistic - A Google Case Study

### Brief Summary
>Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, operates a bike sharing initiative with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station within the system at any time.<br>
To build general awareness and appeal to a broad range of consumers, Cyclistic employed a marketing strategy that focused on flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes. They constitute a significant portion of Cyclistic users, who predominantly use the bikes for leisure rides. While customers opting for annual memberships are referred to as Cyclistic members. Interestingly, around 30% of users utilize the bikes for daily commutes to work.<br>
The director of marketing at Cyclistic emphasizes that the company's future success hinges on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Thus, we are tasked with finding out how we can achieve greater membership subscriptions
>* Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
>* 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
>* 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
>* 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
